## Sophisticated Algorithms

### 1. Spaced Repetition Engine
```typescript
// SM-2 Algorithm Implementation
function calculateNextReview(quality: number, easeFactor: number, interval: number) {
  // Optimizes review intervals based on memory retention science
  const newEaseFactor = easeFactor + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02));
  // Implements forgetting curve mathematics for optimal retention
}
```

### 2. Schedule Optimization
```typescript
// Multi-objective optimization considering:
// - Deadline urgency (exponential weighting)
// - Cognitive load balancing
// - User productivity patterns
// - Subject dependencies and prerequisites
function generateOptimalSchedule(subjects, constraints, productivityPattern) {
  // Advanced scheduling algorithm with multiple optimization factors
}
```

### 3. Adaptive Learning Analysis
```typescript
// Machine learning approach to analyze user patterns
class AdaptiveLearningAnalyzer {
  static analyzeProductivityPattern(sessions) {
    // Analyzes hourly and daily productivity patterns
    // Calculates optimal session lengths and break intervals
    // Identifies cognitive load patterns and focus decline rates
  }
}
```

### 4. Performance Prediction
```typescript
// Predicts study outcomes using multiple factors
function predictSubjectCompletion(subjects, sessions, productivityPattern) {
  // Calculates completion probability using velocity analysis
  // Considers difficulty adjustments and time constraints
  // Provides confidence intervals and risk assessments
}
```

## Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanketmuchhala/AIStudyBuddy.git
    cd AIStudyBuddy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gcp_api_key
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Environment Variables

-   `PORT`: The port for the server to listen on (default: `8080`).
-   `NODE_ENV`: The node environment (`development` or `production`).
-   `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google Gemini.
-   `PROVIDER`: The AI provider to use (`gemini` or `mock`). The `mock` provider is useful for local development without an API key.

## Railway Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Railway. The `railway.json` file in the root of the project defines the build and deploy commands.

To deploy your own instance, you can use the "Deploy to Railway" button or connect your forked repository to a new Railway project.

You will need to configure the `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable in the Railway project settings.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Build Failures:** Clear `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies.
-   **API Errors:** Check your environment variables and API keys.

## Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive, modern UI
- **Date-fns** for intelligent date manipulation
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
