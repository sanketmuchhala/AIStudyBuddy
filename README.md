## 🔬 **Sophisticated Algorithms**

### 1. **Spaced Repetition Engine**
```typescript
// SM-2 Algorithm Implementation
function calculateNextReview(quality: number, easeFactor: number, interval: number) {
  // Optimizes review intervals based on memory retention science
  const newEaseFactor = easeFactor + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02));
  // Implements forgetting curve mathematics for optimal retention
}
```

### 2. **Schedule Optimization**
```typescript
// Multi-objective optimization considering:
// - Deadline urgency (exponential weighting)
// - Cognitive load balancing
// - User productivity patterns
// - Subject dependencies and prerequisites
function generateOptimalSchedule(subjects, constraints, productivityPattern) {
  // Advanced scheduling algorithm with multiple optimization factors
}
```

### 3. **Adaptive Learning Analysis**
```typescript
// Machine learning approach to analyze user patterns
class AdaptiveLearningAnalyzer {
  static analyzeProductivityPattern(sessions) {
    // Analyzes hourly and daily productivity patterns
    // Calculates optimal session lengths and break intervals
    // Identifies cognitive load patterns and focus decline rates
  }
}
```

### 4. **Performance Prediction**
```typescript
// Predicts study outcomes using multiple factors
function predictSubjectCompletion(subjects, sessions, productivityPattern) {
  // Calculates completion probability using velocity analysis
  // Considers difficulty adjustments and time constraints
  // Provides confidence intervals and risk assessments
}
```
